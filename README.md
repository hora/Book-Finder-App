# Refactoring a Student Project

This repo is a record of my feedback on a student project.
My student [@IrvHenri](https://github.com/IrvHenri) built a Book Finder App
using the Google Books API, and I
offered him feedback in the form of a code refactor.

## @IrvHenri's Project Page

To see the most current version of this project, see [@IrvHenri's repository](https://github.com/IrvHenri/Book-Finder-App)
which also includes screenshots and a live demo.

## Refactoring Suggestions

@IrvHenri's code as it was when I went over it for feedback can be seen in the
[original](https://github.com/hora/Book-Finder-App/tree/original) branch.
My refactored code is in the
[refactored](https://github.com/hora/Book-Finder-App/tree/refactored) branch.

However, to view my suggestions with detailed comments, I recommend you have a
look at [PR #1](https://github.com/hora/Book-Finder-App/pull/1) (which compares
these two branches).
